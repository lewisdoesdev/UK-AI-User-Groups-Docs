# Speaker Slide Deck Template

Find below a link to the Bletchley AI User Group example of our speaker slide deck template. We will publish a copy for each of our user groups with their relevant logos here soon. Your speakers are most welcome to use these templates as a baseline but we do not require the use of the UK AI templates in speaker sessions. Speakers can bring their own brand.
