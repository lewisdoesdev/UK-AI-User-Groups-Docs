# Social Media Templates

Here you can find a copy of the UK AI User Groups social media templates. As a user group leader you should use these when publishing content for your user group on public channels such as Meetup, and our LinkedIn profile.

If you have any questions surrounding the use of these templates, ask your national committee buddy who will be able to help you or route your query.
