# Partnership with the Global AI Community

The UK AI User Groups are proud to partner with the Global AI Community to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among AI enthusiasts worldwide. As part of this partnership, all UK AI User Groups are encouraged to set up as official Global AI Chapters.

Becoming a Global AI Chapter provides access to a global network of AI professionals, resources, and events. To register your user group as a chapter, visit the [Global AI Chapters page](https://globalai.community/chapters/) and follow the setup instructions.

This partnership ensures that our community remains connected to the latest developments in AI and benefits from the collective expertise of a worldwide network. By becoming a Global AI Chapter, your user group gains access to exclusive benefits, including:

- **Azure Subscriptions**: Complimentary Azure credits to support your AI projects and initiatives.
- **Slack Workspace**: Access to a dedicated Slack workspace for collaboration with other Global AI Chapters.
- **MeetUp Support**: Assistance with setting up and managing your MeetUp group to grow your local AI community.
